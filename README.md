# Text_To_Eat

## Overview
The Text-to-Eat Kiosk app is intended to allow users to place restaurant, cafeteria, or fast food orders using the text chat and voice option rather than the traditional method of going through a menu at a kiosk or ordering through a cashier. This is intended to decrease the amount of time using voice recognition or simply typing out their order as required reducing the amount of time spent looking at a menu.

## Setup
To clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ChrisTressler/Text_To_Eat.git

## Techonology
We are using Python for this entire project using Flask for the frontend and calling upon the OpenAI API for the LLM interface.
