# Text_To_Eat

## Overview
The Text-to-Eat Kiosk app is intended to allow users to place restaurant, cafeteria, or fast food orders using the text chat and voice option rather than the traditional method of going through a menu at a kiosk or ordering through a cashier. This is intended to decrease the amount of time using voice recognition or simply typing out their order as required reducing the amount of time spent looking at a menu.

## Setup
To clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ChrisTressler/Text_To_Eat.git

## Techonology
Express.js will serve as the back-end framework, managing essential operations such as menu selection and cart functionalities. React Router will facilitate seamless navigation between different states/pages within the application. The front-end interface will be designed using React alongside TailwindCSS for responsive and modern UI components. OpenAI's Node.js SDK integration will enable the chat interface powered by a large language model (LLM), enhancing user interaction through natural language processing. WebSpeech API will provide the voice-to-text capabilities. Menu items and pricing information will be stored in a static JSON file, while cart data will be dynamically managed through Javascript's localStorage. Finally, we will use Git Hub Actions to automate the deployment process and GitHub Pages to host our project.
